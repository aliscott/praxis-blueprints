Praxis Blueprints is a library that allows for defining a reusable class structures that has a set of typed attributes and a set of views with which to render them. Instantiations of Blueprints resemble ruby Structs which respond to methods of the attribute names. Rendering is format-agnostic in that
it results in a structured hash instead of an encoded string. Blueprints can automatically generate object structures that follow the attribute definitions.
